    <h1>Scope</h1>
    <p>This Technical Specification describes extensions to the C++ 
    Programming Language (<cxx-ref to="intro.references"></cxx-ref>) that
    enable the specification of Transactional Memory. These extensions include 
    new syntactic forms and modifications to existing language and library.</p>

    <p>The International Standard, ISO/IEC 14882, provides important context
    and specification for this Technical Specification. This document is 
    written as a set of changes against that specification. Instructions
    to modify or add paragraphs are written as explicit instructions. 
    Modifications made directly to existing text from the International
    Standard use <ins>underlining</ins> to represent added text and
    <del>strikethrough</del> to represent deleted text. <new>New text use a deep green color</new></p>
            
      <p>This Technical Specification is non-normative. Some of the functionality
      described by this Technical Specification may be considered for standardization
      in a future version of C++, but it is not currently part of any C++ standard.
      Some of the functionality in this Technical Specification may never be
      standardized, and other functionality may be standardized in a substantially
      changed form.</p>
      
      <p>The goal of this Technical Specification is to build widespread existing
      practice for Transactional Memory. It gives
      advice on extensions to those vendors who wish to provide them.</p>
