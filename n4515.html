<h2>History</h2>


<h3>Lenexa (2015-05-08)</h3>
<p> passed EWG, CWG, LWG review. LEWG did not need to review the PDTS comment N4410 </p>
<p>
Move to approve N4513 as the Transactional Memory TS working paper 
and direct the Convener to transmit N4514 for publication as the Transactional Memory TS. 
Approvde unaimously in Lenexa	
</p>	
<p>
N4513 is the latest TM TS Working Draft. It contains changes to the TM TS as directed 
by the committee at the Lenexa meeting based on the PDTS ballot comments.
</p>
<p>
N4514 is document N4513 reformatted as a PDTS ballot document.
</p>
<p>
	N4515 is this document - TM TS Editor's report, post Lenexa.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Addresed NB PDTS comments in N4396 by N4410.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Post-Urbana (2014-11-21)</h3>

<p>N4396 is the PDTS 19841 NB comments </p>
<p>N4410 is SG5's responses to the PDTS comments in N4396>
</p>
<p> 
N4301 is the latest TM TS Working Draft. It contains changes to the TM TS as directed 
by the committee at the Urbana meeting combining N4272 and N4265.
</p>
<p>
N4302 is document N4301 reformatted as a PDTS ballot document.
</p>
<p>
	N4338 is this document - TM TS Editor's report, post Urbana.
</p>







<h3>Urbana (2014-11-07)</h3>


<h4>	 Motion 3 (approved unanimously)</h4>
<p>
Move to create a working paper for the Technical Specification on C++ Extensions for 
Transactional Memory with N4272, "Technical Specification on C++ Extensions for 
Transactional Memory, Working Draft Header" and N4265, 
"Transactional Memory Support for C++: Wording (revision 3)" as its initial content.
</p>
<p>
	N4272 has the Working Draft front matter.
</p>
 
<p>
N4265 presents the wording proposal including changes from Urbana (both core and
library) for integrating transactional memory support into C++.  For
motivation and introductory overview, see the predecessor paper N3999
"Standard Wording for Transactional Memory Support for C++".
</p>

<h3>Pre-Urbana (2014-10-10)</h3>
<p>
The companion paper N4180 motivates and explains the additional
features that have been integrated since the Rapperswil meeting. Those
were approved by EWG in Urbana.
</p>

<p>
N4179 presents the pre-Urbana integrated TM wording for core and library.
</p>

<h3>Pre-Rapperswil (2014-05-23)</h3>
<p>
N3999 presents a concise set of introduction, motivation, syntax, semantics and initial wording.
</p>
<p>
N4000 documents our effort to transactionalize a C++ Standard Template Library (STL) 
container to demonstrate the feasibility of the transactional language constructs.
</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Addressed comments from 2014-06-02 review teleconference,
clarifying the wording.</li>
<li>Address CWG review comments from Rapperswil:
<ul>
<li>allow "synchronizes with" for non-library constructs</li>
<li>volatile subobjects are tx-unsafe</li>
<li>remove cross-translation unit safe-by-default</li>
<li>simplified lambda transaction-safety</li>
<li>redeclarations can omit <code>transaction_safe</code></li>
<li>comparing pointers is unspecified unless tx-safety is the same</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Address LWG review comments from Rapperswil:

<ul>
<li>added more cross-references in the library section</li>
<li>prohibit additional tx-safe annotations by library
implementations using the same words as for constexpr</li>
<li>for exception types that support tx cancellation, add notes about required implementation support</li>
<li>remove rand/srand, because some implementation use global
state where accesses are synchronized using a mutex</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>add implicit conversion from "pointer to transaction_safe
member function" to "pointer to member function" (see
4.14)</li>

<li>clarify definition of transaction-safe (defined term)</li>

<li>added [[optimize_for_synchronized]] attribute (see section 7.6.6
[dcl.attr.sync])</li>

<li>added <code>transaction_safe noinherit</code> for virtual
functions (non-viral)</li>

<li>added transaction-safety for all containers and iterator-related
functions</li>

<li>added <code>tx_exception</code></li>

<li>Addressed comments from 2014-09-15 CWG review teleconference
</li>
<li>matching a <em>handler</em> performs transaction-safety conversions</li>
<li>allow, but do not require <code>transaction_safe</code> on lambdas
</li><li>a <code>transaction_safe noinherit</code> function overriding a <code>transaction_safe</code> function is ill-formed</li>
<li>template argument deduction performs transaction-safety conversions</li>
<li>allow forming a composite pointer type using a transaction-safety conversion</li>
</ul>

</li>

<li>rename <code>maybe transaction_safe</code> to <code>transaction_safe noinherit</code>

</li><li>Addressed comments from 2014-11-04 LWG review&lt;
<ul>

<li>for the containers, make one blanket statement covering
all required functions and operations instead of detailed per-function
lists</li>

<li>reflect that not only user-provided functions, but also
built-in operations can make an instantiation of standard library
function template unsafe (e.g. std::copy invoked with "volatile int *"
parameters)</li>

<li>consider additional overloads in &lt;cxxx&gt; headers
(compared to the corresponding xxx.h header) for
tx-safety</li>

<li>C library functions should not be "declared" transaction-safe to
leave more room for implementers to have special compiler magic, not
requiring actual modifications of C headers</li>

<li>restrict <code>tx_exception</code> to trivially copyable
types</li>

<li>iterators of containers and rebound allocators are required to be
transaction-safe</li>

<li>also cover numerics algorithms (section 26.7)</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Renamed "transaction_safe noinherit" to
"transaction_safe_noinherit" per 2014-11-05 EWG review</li>

<li>Addressed comments from 2014-11-05 LWG review

</li><li>Addressed comments from 2014-11-05 CWG review
<ul>
<li>do not inherit transaction_safe for redeclarations; allow that explicit specializations differ</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>





<h2>Resolved issues</h2>

<ul>

<li>Under which circumstances is a lambda function (implicitly)
declared transaction-safe? [It is declared tx-safe if its definition
is (directly) safe and all invoked functions are tx-safe.] Do we want
to allow an explicit transaction_safe/unsafe annotation? [Yes to the
former.]</li>

<li>Is the term "transaction-statement" still ok, or should that be
renamed to "atomic-statement", in line with the (new) spelling of the
keywords? <em>Telco 2014-03-31: use "atomic block" and
"transaction-safe".</em></li>

<li>Allow conversion of "pointer to transaction-safe member function"
to "pointer to member function"</li>

<li>add "transaction_safe noinherit" for virtual functions</li>

<li><code>std::exception</code> is the base of the exception
hierarchy. Should we declare its virtual what() function
<code>transaction_safe</code>?  [no; instead review definition of
derived classes such as length_error] This has serious ripple effects
to user code, in particular if that user code is totally unaware of
transactions. <em>Telco 2014-08-11 and 2014-09-08: introduce "maybe
transaction_safe" for virtual functions, which is not viral, but
accepts undefined behavior.</em></li>

<li>For "composite pointer type" in 5 [expr], address that T might be
"pointer to function" (not transaction-safe) vs. "pointer to
transaction-safe function".  This can be unified to "pointer to
function" (not transaction-safe).</li>

<li>Introduce a
<pre>template&lt;class T&gt;
class tx_exception : exception { ... };
</pre>

with a transaction-safe "what()" function and where "T" can be
memcpy'd.</li>

<li>add "template specialization can be tx-safe even
when corresponding member of the template is not"</li>

</ul>
